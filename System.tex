\section{Hardware}
The different hardware components used in this work is a \gls{uav}, payload computer, \gls{gnss} receiver and antenna.
\subsection{UAV}\label{ss:SkywalkerX8}
The \gls{uav} used is a Skywalker X8, see figure \ref{figure:skywalkerX8}, which is a fixed wing \acrfull{uav} that is moulded out of \gls{epo}, which makes it a cheap and robust platform for prototype testing and modifications. The large space within the fuselage makes it ideal for experimental payload and projects with modest requirements.

\end{figure}
The X8 has a wingspan of $2120mm$ which allow for a Maximum Take-Off Wight of $4.2kg$, including $1kg$ for the payload. The X8 used in this work is outfitted in according to the specification given in \citep{KlausenX8}. The components that is used in the X8 at the UAVLAB is given in table \ref{tb:X8Components}.

\end{table}
\subsection{Embedded Computer}
The embedded computer chosen as payload in the X8 is a Beaglebone Black, shown in figure \ref{figure:BeagleBone}. The Beaglebone was chosen because of its sufficient computation power, low energy consumption and variety of communication interfaces. For ease interface access the  the Uavlab at NTNU has developed an extension board called "CAPE".

		\label{figure:BeagleBone}
\end{figure}
The Beaglebone black supports linux operation systems, and it is compatible with the \gls{lsts} toolchain, which will be return to in \ref{S:software}.
\subsection{GNSS receiver}
The system will use two types of \gls{gnss} receivers, namely the Ublox LEA M8T and the Piksi system. 

The Ublox LEA M8T is a new generation of low-cost \gls{gnss} receiver from ublox. The receiver support sending out raw \gls{gnss} data from both \gls{gps} and \gls{glonass} in the same configuration. The receiver have great performance in acquisition and tracking sensitivity of \gls{gnss} satellites. More technical details can be found in  \citep{UbloxDataSheet,UbloxReceiverDescription}.

		\label{figure:Ublox}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Piksi}\label{ss:Piksi}
The Piksi system is a low cost, high performance \gls{gps} receiver with \gls{rtk-gps} functionality with capability for centimeter level relative positioning accuracy developed by Swift Navigation, shown in figure \ref{figure:Piksi}. Piksi is ideal for autonomous vehicles because of its small form factor, fast position solution update rate and low power consumption. 
More detailed information about Piksi can be found in \citep{Piksiv231}

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/piksi_top.jpg}
		\caption{Communication structure for Piksi}
		\label{figure:CommunicationPiksi}
\end{figure}
\subsection{GNSS Antenna}
The navigation system will use two \gls{gnss} antenna, one for the \gls{uav} and the other for the base station. The main criteria for the \gls{uav} antenna is that it's small,compact and have a light weight.

The M1227HTC-A-SMA, seen in figure \ref{figure:Maxtena} has been used in other \gls{uav} setups at the UAVLAB with good results. The antenna is small, compact and with an light weight of $17g$. It's design for L1/L2 gps/glonass bands. Further information or specification can be found in the datasheet \citep{maxtena}

The base station do not have any restriction on size, weight or aerodynamic. The important factor for a base station antenna is that it has good multipath rejection. Also the base station position should be calculated as accurate as possible which impose further restriction on interference handling, phase center stability and noise rejection.

The Novatel GPS-701-GG, seen i figure \ref{figure:Novatel}, was chosen as the base station antenna. The antenna has excellent multipath rejection whit a highly stable phase center. It has reception for both \gls{gps} and \gls{glonass} \gls{l1} signals.Further information or specification can be found in the datasheet \citep{novatel}.

\section{Software}\label{S:software}
This section contain the different software that is used in the X8 system. The following sections contain the operating system that runs on the base station and rover, the middleware used to perform the different tasks, the messages protocol, the missionplaner program and rtklib which will have the main focus.
\subsection{LSTS toolchain}
The Laboratório de Sistemas e Tecnologia Subaquática (LSTS) toolchain is used a platform for software implementation. This is a flexible, scalable, open-source software that supports integration and control of various types of unmanned vehicles \citep{pinto2013lsts}. The toolchain includes a operating system, runtime environment, message protocol and a command and control for operations. The following program is included in the toolchain
\subsubsection{GLUED}
Glued is a minimal Linux operating system distribution, and design with embedded system in mind. It is platform independent, easy to configure and contain only the necessary packages to run on a embedded system. This makes GLUED a light and fast distribution. GLUED is configured through a single configuration file that which can be created for a specific system. 
\subsubsection{Dune}
Dune (DUNE Uniform Navigation Environment) is a runtime environment for unmanned systems. DUNE is operating system independent and can run on-board the embedded computer. It can interact with the sensors, actuators and payload. It can also be used for tasks like communication, navigation, control, manoeuvring, plan execution and supervision.

Dune works by setting up individual task that can dispatch and subscribe to different \gls{imc} messages.
\subsubsection{IMC}\label{ss:IMC}
The \acrfull{imc} protocol is build to interconnect systems of vehicles,sensors and human operators. The protocol is a messages-oriented protocol that enable exchange of real-time information about the environment and updated objectives, such that the participant in the communication can pursue a common goal cooperatively.
\gls{imc} has a standard way of dispatching and consuming messages, which abstracts hardware configuration from the software. All \gls{imc} messages are logged by DUNE.

%Other feature: Not assuming a specific software architecture, can generate native support for different programming languages and/or computer architectures. Used in network nodes, inter-process and inter thread communication
\subsubsection{Neptus}
Neptus is an open source command and control software that can be used for a single or fleet of unmanned vehicles with different types of sensors. The operator can observe real time data from a vehicle, review previous missions and plan future mission. In this work Neptus has been used to extract data logged by Dune during a defined mission, and to monitor the integer ambiguity solution from \gls{rtklib} and Piksi.
\subsection{RTKLIB}\label{ss:Rtklib}
\acrfull{rtklib} is a open source program package for standard and precise positioning with GNSS developed by T. Takasu. \gls{rtklib} can use raw GNSS data to estimate the position of the rover. \gls{rtklib} can be configured to give a position solution in real time in differential mode. Figure \ref{figure:RTKLIB_STRUCTURE} shows how \gls{rtklib} can be used in a RTKGNSS mode. The two main moduels here is str2str and rtkrcv. Both will be explained more closely in the following sections. More information about  \gls{rtklib} can be found in \citep{Rtklib242}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/RTKLIB.png}
		\caption{The communication structure of \gls{rtklib}}
		\label{figure:RTKLIB_STRUCTURE}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Rtkrcv}
As part of the \gls{rtklib} Rtkrcv is  used to calculate the position of the rover in real time.
Rtkrcv can be configured to have two output streams. The structure of the output stream is given the \gls{rtklib} manual\citep{Rtklib242}. It's desired in a automatic landing system that have that velocity solution. This is was not provided in the newest version of \gls{rtklib}, and therefore the source code was altered to send out the velocity data. The position output is in \gls{enu} format and the full output structure is shown in table \ref{Tb:RtklibOutput}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l |}
    \hline
    \textbf{Header} & \textbf{Content} \\ \hline
     1 Time & The epoch time of the solution indicate the true receiver\\& signal reception time. Can have the following format:\\&\\& yyyy/mm/dd HH:MM:SS.SSS:\\& Calender time in GPST, UTC or JST.\\&\\&
     
     WWWW SSSSSSS.SSS:\\&
     GPS week and TOW in seconds  \\ \hline
     2 Receiver Position & The rover receive antenna position \\ \hline
     3 Quality flag (Q) & The flag which indicates the solution quality.\\& 1:Fixed\\& 2:Float\\& 5:Single \\ \hline
     4 Number of valid satellites (ns) & The number of valid satellites for solution estimation. \\ \hline
     5 Standard deviation & The estimated standard deviation of the\\& solution assuming a priori error model and error\\& parameters by the positioning options \\ \hline
     6 Age of differential & The time difference between the observation data epochs\\& of the rover receiver and base station in second. \\ \hline
     7 Ratio factor & The ratio factor of "ratio-test" for standard integer\\& ambiguity validation strategy \\ \hline
     8 Receiver velocity & The velocity of the rover. Given only when output is\\& in enu format \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Rtklib output solution format }
\label{Tb:RtklibOutput}
\end{table}
When set configured as a differential GPS rtkrcv uses the \gls{lambda} method to resolve the integer ambiguity., which is further explained in \citep{LAMBDAMETHOD}. The solution is considered fixed if the ration between the best estimate and the second best estimate is above a certain threshold.

The position solution is calculated with a Extended Kalman Filter, that can have different structure depending on how rtkrcv is configured
\subsubsection{Str2str}
Str2str is used as a base station program that can retrieve raw \gls{gnss} data and create a tcp sever, which the rtkrcv program can connect itself as a client. Str2str sends out RMTC3 formatted messages, however it can be configured to send whatever comes in as input.
\section{Implementation}
This section explain how the \gls{rtk-gps} navigation system has been implemented in the \gls{uav} system used in the testing. The implementation includes both a software and a hardware part, as shown i figure \ref{figure:HardSoft}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/Combined.png}
		\caption{Hardware Software interaction}
		\label{figure:HardSoft}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Software implementation}
The software implemented is shown in figure \ref{figure:HardSoft}, where the different modules are available from the UAVLAB. The detailed implementation has been trough configuration of the config files, including alteration of the existing implementation.
\subsubsection{RTKGPS}
The \gls{rtk-gps} module in the navigation system includes \gls{rtklib}, and the two Dune tasks RTKGPS and Piksi. The RTKGPS task is connected to \gls{rtklib} though a virtual connection, and the Piksi task has a physical connection to the Piksi receiver, as shown i figure \ref{figure:HardSoft}.


\gls{rtklib} is implemented into the base station and the rover. The base station implementation use the  str2str program to communicate with the Ublox over a uart cable, outputs raw \gls{gnss} data over tcp to the rover.
The rover uses the rtkrcv program from \gls{rtklib} to estimate the position of the rover. Rtkrcv receive raw \gls{gnss} data from both the str2str program and the Ublox installed in the \gls{uav}, as shown in figure \ref{figure:RTKLIB_STRUCTURE}. Rtkrcv is configured in a moving baseline configuration to simulate the behaviour that is expected during a landing on a ship. The configuration file is included in \ref{APPENDIX:RTKLIB}.

The output from the RTKGPS task is a \gls{imc} message called RtkFix, see table \ref{Tb:RtkFix}, which include the relative position of the \gls{uav} as well as the velocity, type of integer solution and the \gls{gps} \acrfull{tow}. The \gls{imc} message is further sent to an external computer for monitoring over TCP/IP (Wifi).

    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{The \gls{imc} message RtkFix }
\label{Tb:RtkFix}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hardware implementation}
Both the base station and \gls{uav} has been fitted with a \gls{gps} antenna splitter, seen i figure \ref{figure:AntennaSplitter}, such that both receivers receive the same signals from the antennas. GLUED is used as the operating system in the Beaglebone on both the base station and the \gls{uav}. The Piksi and Ublox is connected with the Beaglebone over uart cables. The primary data-link between the \gls{uav} and the base station with Ubiquiti AirMax radios.
The embedded computer uses GLUED as its operating system, and on it runs both Dune and \gls{rtklib}. The Piksi and Ublox is connected to the BeagleBone over uart cables.
More information on the hardware setup used in the X8 and the Base station is given in \citep{KlausenX8}
