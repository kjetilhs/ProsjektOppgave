\chapter{Experimental testing}
This chapter contain the result from the test that were performed. The goal with these test was to evaulate the ublox receiver againgst the pixi receiver, and to get a impresion on the accuracy to the rtklib solution with ublox. The comparison test was performed with the pixi and ublox connected to the same antenna at both the rover and the base station. Then the deviation in the position estimate can only come from the receivers. The accuracy test of the ublox was tested by performing the same manoeuvre several times.
