\chapter{Real time kinematic GPS}
This chapter outline the basic on how RTKGPS works. It's assumed that the reader is familiar with how a single GPS receiver works. The first section give a brief summary on what differential GPS is, and how that principle is applied in RTK-GPS. The two following sections is directly used in RKT-GPS(maybe write some more). The last section give a quick overview over the error sources that effect the measurement.
\section{Differential GPS}
Differential GPS consist of at least two receivers, where one is called a base station and the rest rovers. The two receivers are within range of a communication channel over which they are communicating. 
\section{Interger Ambiguity Resolution}
\subsection{Search space minimization strategies}
\section{Error sources}
