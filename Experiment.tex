\chapter{Experimental testing}
This chapter contain the result from the test that were performed. The goal with these test was to evaulate the ublox receiver againgst the pixi receiver, and to get a impresion on the accuracy to the rtklib solution with ublox. The comparison test was performed with the pixi and ublox connected to the same antenna at both the rover and the base station. Then the deviation in the position estimate can only come from the receivers. The accuracy test of the ublox was tested by performing the same manoeuvre several times. 
\section{Physical testing}
The physical experiment were done in two parts. During the first part the x8 was carried around on a open field. The goal with this experiment was to log data from rtklib and piksi, and then compare how they deviated from each other. The second part of the physical experiment was flying (SKRIV NÅR FLYVING ER GJENNNOMFØRT)
\subsection{Fly test}

\subsection{GPS test}
The experiment started when both rtklib and piksi would signal that they had a fixed integer solution.
