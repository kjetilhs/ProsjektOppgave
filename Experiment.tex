\chapter{Experimental testing}
This chapter contain the result from the test that were performed. The goal with these test was to evaulate the ublox receiver againgst the pixi receiver, and to get a impresion on the accuracy to the rtklib solution with ublox. The comparison test was performed with the pixi and ublox connected to the same antenna at both the rover and the base station. Then the deviation in the position estimate can only come from the receivers. The accuracy test of the ublox was tested by performing the same manoeuvre several times.

All position and velocity data is given in the \gls{ned} frame. 
Can mension the gnss radar used to find good gps windows.
\section{Physical testing}
The physical experiment were done in two parts. During the first part the x8 was carried around on a open field. The goal with this experiment was to log data from rtklib and piksi, and then compare how they deviated from each other. The second part of the physical experiment was flying 

\subsection{GPS test}
In this part two sessions of navigation data will be presented. Both sessions were performed on the same day, which was cloudless and at a time with low \gls{dop}. The raw data from the Ublox receiver was post processed with rtklib, and is should be more accurate than it's real time counter part. Therefore a error was defined as:
\begin{equation}
e(t) = p_r(t) - p_p(t)
\end{equation}
where $p_r(t)$ and $p_p(t)$ is defined as the position solution from the real time system and the position solution from the post processed solution respectfully. It should be noted that in order to compare the different time-series the position data was synchronized with each other. From the error the cumulative mean error and cumulative standard deviation for the error was calculated using the matlab function "mean" and "std".
\subsubsection{First session}
Figure \ref{figure:xywalk1} shows a North East plot of how the walk was. The plot contain only the fixed solution from both the piksi and rtklib.

		\label{figure:xywalk1}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{figure:DownAndAmbwalk1} shows the down position, as well as how the integer ambiguity solution was during the experiment. As seen in the figure both the Piksi and Rtklib manage to keep there fixed solution. The position solution from both the Piksi and Rtklib agrees with the post processed solution.

\end{figure}

As seen in figure \ref{figure:xywalk1} the difference between the different solution appear to be small, which is comfirmed in the error plot shown in figure \ref{figure:errorRTKwalk1} and \ref{figure:errorPiksiwalk1}

\end{figure}
The small variasion in the position error can be seen in figure \ref{figure:stdPiksi} and \ref{figure:stdRTK}.

\end{figure}
Both the Piksi and \gls{rtklib} appear to be able to correctly estimate the North and East velocity, as seen in figure \ref{figure:VelocityWalk1}. However the Down velocity from \gls{rtklib} is more noisy then the Piksi.

\end{figure}
%The problem with the \gls{tow} is shown more clearly in figure \ref{figure:timeRTKwalk1}. The figure display the time difference between each output. The first part is an altered version of the \gls{tow} from rtklib, while the other is the timestamp of the same output given by Dune. The output from rtklib gave only seconds, and not a millisecond value. To correct for this error the \gls{tow} value from rtklib altered to fill the gap between each second. The alteration was done by counting the number of elements with the same \gls{tow} value, and then equally spread them from between the \gls{tow} value to the next \gls{tow} value.
%
%The timestamp given by Dune indicate the delay a output message from rtklib might experience before it's available for consumption. Both the timestamp and \gls{tow} value indicate that rtklib has a mean output of 5 Hz. Here it should be noted that the ublox was configured with a output rate of 10 Hz.

%Figure \ref{figure:timePiksiWalk1} shows the time difference between each output sample. The first plot shows the difference between each \gls{tow} value from Piksi, and the other the difference between each time stamp given by Dune. Both plots indicate that Piksi is able to have a output frequency at 10 Hz.

The different receiver used in Rtklib and Piksi was not able to track the same satellites at all time. Figure \ref{figure:NumSatWalk1} shows that the Ublox LEA M8T receiver connected to Rtklib managed to track more satellite then the receiver used in Piksi.

\end{figure}
The position estimate of the rover is a relative position in reference to the base station. Due to the fact that the position of the base station is calculated with a single receiver with one frequency, there will be introduced a bias in the position estimate. Figure \ref{figure:enhancedxywalk1} shows the North, East position of the the first walk. The true position is exactly the same, but in the figure it appear that the distance is approximately $5cm$. The distance from the base station to the estimated start and stop position was calculated to be $3.29m$ and $3.26$ respectfully. The measured distance was approximately $3.3m$. That gives an initial error off $0.04m$. This gives an accuracy level at centimeter level at stationary condition.

		\label{figure:enhancedxywalk1}
\end{figure}
Given that the error given in figure \ref{figure:errorPiksiwalk1} and \ref{figure:errorRTKwalk1} is never has a greater absolute value then $0.2m$ it's possible to assume that the true error will be bellow $1m$ which was given as an evasion criterion in the MSc thesis by \citep{Froelich}, if the \gls{rtk-gps} system has a fixed integer solution.

\subsubsection{Second session}
During the second session the Piksi lost its fixed integer solution, while Rtklib managed to keep its fixed integer solution as seen in figure \ref{figure:xyWalk2} and \ref{figure:downWalk2}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/xywalk2.eps}
		\caption{Visable statellite for the piksi and rtklib}

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/downWalk2.eps}
		\caption{Visable statellite for the piksi and rtklib}
		\label{figure:downWalk2}
\end{figure}
The reason for why the Piksi lost its fixed solution might be because it lost track of several satellite.

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/numSatWalk2.eps}
		\caption{Visable statellite for the piksi and rtklib}

\end{figure}
\subsection{In-flight test}
A flight test with the \gls{uav} was performed at Udduvoll. Because of bad weather the were only performed one flight, and before the flight started only the Rtklib had a fixed solution. That is why in this part only performance from the Rtklib is considered, as a fixed solution is a must for a automatic landing system. 

During the flight test the integer ambiguity solution were more float then fixed as seen in figure \ref{figure:DownFlight} and \ref{figure:northEastFlight}, which affected the measurement.

	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/northEastFlight.eps}

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/downFlight.eps}
		\caption{Velocity data from the piksi and rtklib real time solution}
		\label{figure:DownFlight}
\end{figure}
The main reason for this behaviour is because of the number of valid satellite the receiver can track experience large variation, as seen i figure \ref{figure:numSatFlight}.

%\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Landing}
Figure \ref{figure:landingNorthEastFlight} and \ref{figure:landingDownFlight} shows the landing, as well as the integer solution type. During the landing the \gls{rtk-gps} system was unable to maintain a fixed solution, however it did maintain a float solution.  
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/landingNorthEastFlight.eps}
		\caption{Velocity data from the piksi and rtklib real time solution}
		\label{figure:landingNorthEastFlight}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/landingDownFlight.eps}
		\caption{Velocity data from the piksi and rtklib real time solution}
		\label{figure:landingDownFlight}
\end{figure}
From the error plot seen in figure \ref{figure:landingErrorNorthEastDownFlight} it appear that to be able to estimate it's own position with an error bellow 1 meter most of the time. However this is compared to the post processed estimate, which also will diverge from the true value.

\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/plots/landingErrorNorthEastDownFlight.eps}
		\caption{Velocity data from the piksi and rtklib real time solution}
		\label{figure:landingErrorNorthEastDownFlight}
\end{figure}
The landing velocity seen in \ref{figure:landingVelocity} confirms the trend see in the first session. The North and East velocity seams to get a nice estimate, however that is not the case with the Down velocity. The Down velocity estimate appear noisy, and not suited for input into a control system.
