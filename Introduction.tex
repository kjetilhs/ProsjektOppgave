\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background and motivation}
In the resent past the development of flying \glspl{uav} have seen to provide an attractive alternative to task previously performed by manned alternatives. Typical task which has attracted attention includes inspection, aerial photography, environmental surveillance and search and rescue. Today \gls{uav} are mostly operated over land, but in the future this will include the out at sea as well. This will give some challenges that must be overcome. One of these challenges is that the \gls{uav} should be able to perform a autonomous landing.

A \gls{uav} can increase performance in many maritime operation where today only other manned aircraft or satellites are the only solution. In the maritime sector they can be used in iceberg management, monitoring of oil spills, search and rescue and maritime traffic monitoring. To enable a safe \gls{uav} operation at sea there must be a system in place to ensure a safe landing.

There exist landing system that can guide the \gls{uav} towards a net, but they are expensive and restricted to a few \glspl{uav}. A pilot could always land the \gls{uav}, but it would be better if the \gls{uav} could hit the net by it self. In order to make the \gls{uav} able to perform a automatic landing the minimum requirement is that it know where it is at all time. This require a accurate position estimation in real time. A highly accurate position sensor is typically expensive, however it's possible to achieve a accurate solution with low cost sensors. By combining two \gls{gnss} receivers it's possible to estimate the relative position of one of the receivers in respect of the other receiver highly accurately. This work will test a new generation of \gls{gnss} receiver, and use \gls{gps} to find the relative position of the \gls{uav}. The demand on the accuracy is that the error must be in decimetres to ensure safe landing in the net.

In order to complete an automatic landing a path planner, guidance system and a accurate position estimation system, in addition to the low level control system in the \gls{uav} is required. Such complete system is still subject for development, where only method for achieving the different objectives has been developed, i.e. path planner and guidance system respectively. The path planer and guidance system as basis for this work was developed as previous master thesis work in the UAVLAB by \citep{Froelich}. The gudiance system is currently under further development in two project thesis. A key component in the guidance system is the position estimation system, which for the guidance referenced was developed by \citep{Spockeli}. However, this system has been concluded to be in-sufficient with respect to provide means required for automatic landing. This work will continue the research done by Spockeli, and introduce a new GNSS receiver that will be used with the open source program, rtklib. The motivation is to have a system with accurate local position estimate, such that in the future a landing can be performed automatic.

The automatic landing system will use RTK GPS for position estimation. The main motivation for this work is to describe the gaps of the available position system sufficient to scope further work required for closure of such gaps ultimately providing means for position estimating sufficient for completion of automatic landing.

GNSS navigation has been
As part of the NTNU MSc thesis of \citep{Skulstad&Syversen} they successfully demonstrated a net landing with a fixed wing UAV using a low-cost RTK GNSS system. More about how they did it.

An other NTNU MSc thesis by \citep{Spockeli} simulated a net landing with a fixed wing UAV. Here the net was allowed to be dynamical, and the system was design with landing on a ship in mind. The system used artificial neural network to estimate the position of the net.

As part of the Stellenbosch University MSc thesis \citep{smit2013autonomous} demostraded a autonomous landing on a airfield using decoupled linear controllers and DGPS. 

An other vision \citep{kim2013fully}

The uavlab at NTNU has in the last year studied how to perform a autonomous landing with a fixed wing UAV. Automatic landing of a UAV in a net using low-cost single frequency gps is described in \citep{Skulstad&Syversen}, and a path generation system that is integraded with neptus is described in \citep{Froelich}. Research on RTK GPS intergration in Dune is described in \citep{Spockeli}.

Work done on ambiguity

Work done with rtk gps
\citep{Low-costRTK}  \citep{3D-RTK}

There has been done work on autonomous landing system using a vision aided system. The work done in \citep{williams2012intelligent} describe a intelligent vision aided landing system that detect and generate landing waypoints for a unsurveyed airfield. Other work

\section{Goal of thesis}
The goal of this thesis is to test the performance of ublox-LEA M8T GNSS receiver in a real time differential \gls{dgps} configuration. The \gls{rtk-gps} solution will be calculated with the open source program rtklib, which will communicate with a task in DUNE. The solution from rtklib will be compared against the solution from Piksi, and a post processed solution from rtklib. The result from the experiment will be used in the discussion on how to perform a autonomous landing.

\section{System layout}
The current state of the system is that it consist of two parts that has not yet been integrated with each other. The part were which is the main focus of this thesis is the positioning part. The plan is to use \gls{rtk-gps} for positioning estimation. The second part is the path and control path. Currently there has only been done simulation of the guidance system. It shows promising results, but is yet to be integrated with \gls{rtk-gps}. For more information on the subject please read the MSc thesis by \citep{Froelich}. Figure \ref{figure:SystemOverview} gives a overview on how the system may look like. Ideas on how the intergration can be acheived will be given in the future work section.
