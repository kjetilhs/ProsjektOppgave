\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter the background and motivation to why this project thesis has been written. Also reference to privios work, the goal of the thesis and the layout.
\section{Background and motivation}
Why is the project thesis relevant: Installing better GPS to enable better hight estimation

What have I done? Integrated new GPS with DUNE

What is next? Land the UAV. Test algorthm to Frølich, better state estimation 

Unmanned aerial vehicles have in seen an increase usage in the civilian sector on land, where they can be used at a cheaper price then manned aircraft. However this has not yet been the case in the civil maritime sector, due to a harsher environment and smaller landing areas.

A UAV can increase performance in many maritime operation where today only other manned aircraft or satellites are the only solution. In the maritime sector they can be used in iceberg management, monitoring of oil spills, search and rescue and maritime traffic monitoring. To enable a safe UAV operation at sea there must be a system in place to ensure a safe landing.

There exist landing system that can guide the UAV towards a net, but they are expensive and restricted to a few UAVs. A pilot could always land the UAV, but it would be better if the UAV could hit the net by it self. In order to make the UAV able to perform a automatic landing the minimum requirement is that it know where it is at all time. This put a requirement of the position sensor. The position system need to combine low cost with high position accuracy. This thesis will test a new generation of GNSS receiver, and use GPS to find the position to the UAV. The demand on the accuracy is that the error must be in decimetres to ensure safe landing in the net.

A automatic landing system must include a path planner, guidance system and a accurate position estimation system, in addition to the low level control system in the UAV. A path planner and guidance system were created in a master thesis at the uavlab by Marcus Frølich. The gudiance system is currently under further development in two project thesis. A position system was created by Bjørn Spockeli, but it concluded that the GNSS receiver used were insufficient to perform automatic landing. This thesis will continue the research done by Spockeli, and introduce a new GNSS receiver that will be used with the open source program, rtklib. The motivation is to have a system with accurate local position estimate, such that in the future a landing can be performed automatic.
The automatic landing system will use RTK GPS for position estimation. 
Motivation for work: Autonomos landing. Required accurate posisioning system, a feasable path, tuned guidence system, robust lav nivå kontroll. Include a system figure can give the reader information on how the autolanding system should work, and why this thesis is relevant.
\section{Previous work}
Work done in the UAVLab on automatic landing. The other master thesis on landing using visual assist. Other method that has been applied. 

Work done in the rtk gps field conserning automatic systems. 

Previous work in the field of ambiguity resolution, rtk gnss, auto landing with fixed wing drone without ground assist.

The work done by Frølich on simulation of a net landing. Work done by Spockeli. Need other research field. GPS navigation is a well researched field. Relevant to this task is landing with gps, or high accurate position estimation. 

Other master thesis, paper on visual aid landing system. Frølich did the same research, using reasearch from Spocli.
\section{Goal of thesis}
Table \ref{Tb:GoalList} summaries the goal with this project thesis.
\begin{itemize}\label{Tb:GoalList}
\item Install the Ublox Lea M8T on the base station and x8
\item Configure rtklib to calculate the relative position of the x8 in relation to the base station
\item Make Dune able to receive the output stream from rtklib, and support a new imc message that contain the relative position of the x8
\item Test and compare the Ublox receiver against the pixi(TRENGER MODEL NAVN) receiver
\end{itemize}
Install new GPS receiver on the x8 and base station. Test and compare to the pixi gps that is the standard solution i the uavlab. Evaluate if the new gps is good enough to enable automatic landing
Install new GPS reciver with higher accuracy to enable automatic landing
\section{System layout}
How the landing can be performed. A operator send a landing request from Neptus to dune. The path generation task generate waypoints in both local and global frame. The global waypoints are return to Neptus to show the operator were the planed path is. The local waypoints are given to a guidance system. The guidance system only requrier the local position, which it will receive from a rtk GNSS task. The rtk GNSS task is required to send both the local position and the global. The global position will be calculated as an offset from the base station location. The local position is the relative position of the UAV with respect to the base station.
