\chapter{Background Theory}
In this chapter outline path planing and position measurement. 
\section{Path planing}
How to find a way, follow a path, geeing from A to B or simply hitting something.
When a system is required to find a way, follow a path, moving from A to B or moving toward something it need to plan a path. The path can have different requirements such as limitation on deviation from path, speed requirement or time requirement. Also it might be that a straight line is not an option. This thiess will focus on the path following part of path planning. The path is given by several wayponits that represent a end of a straight line. En figur an WP hadde v√¶rt fint her.
\subsection{Straight lines}
\subsection{Interpolation}
\subsection{Dubins path}
Include a figure that show dubins path. Might use plots from assignment 3 i Guidance and Control. Same in the two previous subsections. 
\section{GPS}
Basic on how a GPS works. Also write about error sources and method to estimate position.
\subsection{RTKGPS}
