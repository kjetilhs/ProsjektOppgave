\chapter{Coordinate systems}
This chapter will give an overview over different coordinate system and the relationship between them. A coordinate system is used to define a position relative to a origin. The choice of coordinate system is critical when describing the equation of motion. Newtons first law only apply when the origin is viewed as an inertial frame. When navigating on/or close to the surface there are two convension used; ENU and NED. Both the ENU and NED system is defines relative to the center of the Earth.
