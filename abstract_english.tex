Automatic landing of a fixed wing \acrfull{uav} in a net on a ship require a accurate positioning system. To increase availability the system must consist of low-cost components, which exclude the commercial landing system that exist today. \acrfull{rtk-gps} can provide centimeter level accuracy with the use of low-cost \acrfull{gnss} receivers. The accuracy will be reduced in a highly dynamical system like a \gls{uav} due to the processing delay.

This work present software and hardware systems that is used in a navigation system that apply \gls{rtk-gps}. Two different system will be compared against each other, as well as there induvidual performance. The \gls{rtk-gps} system is using single-frequency \gls{gnss} receivers, the Piksi system from Swift Navigation and the open-source \acrfull{rtklib}. 
The \gls{rtk-gps} system is implemented in DUNE(DUNE:Unified Navigation Environment)-framework running on the embedded payload computer on-board the \gls{uav}. Outdoor lab tests and a flight test was used to check the performance of the navigation system.
