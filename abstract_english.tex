Automatic landing of a fixed wing \acrfull{uav} in a net on a ship require a accurate positioning system. To increase general availability the system must consist of low-cost components, which exclude the commercial landing system that exist today. \acrfull{rtk-gps} can provide centimeter level position accuracy with the use of low-cost \acrfull{gnss} receivers. The processing time for the \gls{rtk-gps} system will decrease the accuracy due to its highly dynamical behaviour.

This work present two alternative software and hardware systems that are used in a navigation system which apply \gls{rtk-gps}. Two different systems, \gls{rtklib} and Piksi, will be compared, including their individual performance. The \gls{rtk-gps} system is using single-frequency \gls{gnss} receivers, the Piksi system from Swift Navigation and the open-source \acrfull{rtklib}. 
The \gls{rtk-gps} system is implemented in DUNE(DUNE:Unified Navigation Environment) framework running on the embedded payload computer on-board the \gls{uav}. Outdoor lab tests and a flight test were used to test the performance of the navigation system.

A test of the navigation system was successfully performed, and a \gls{rtk-gps} navigation system has been prepare for integration into a automatic net landing system. The Ublox proved to have superior satellite tracing ability, and combined with \gls{rtklib} proved the best \gls{rtk-gps} systems.
