This work present a navigation system that will be used in a automatic ship landing system for a \gls{uav}. The navigation system apply \gls{rtk-gps} for position estimation, which can provide centimeter level accuracy. If the \gls{uav} is highly dynamical only the past position the position estimate is describing a past position, resulting in reduced accuracy.

What is presented in this work:

Software used to compute the rtk position

Hardware used in implementation in UAV

Receiver used to opptain raw gnss data.

Comparison of two rtkgps able systems, whit two different receivers.

Present Dune which the task is implemented in

What is done: Done some walks with the x8, as well as one flight test.
