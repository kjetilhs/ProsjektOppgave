Automatic landing of a fixed wing \acrfull{uav} in a net on a ship require an accurate positioning system. There exist today high-end systems with such capability for special applications, e.g military systems and costly commercial systems, which restrict the availability of such systems. To increase the general availability these systems must consist of low-cost components. Here, an alternative is the use of low-cost \gls{gnss} receivers and apply \gls{rtk-gps}, which can provide centimeter level position accuracy. However the processing time for the \gls{rtk-gps} system results in degraded accuracy when exposed to highly dynamical behaviour.

This work present two alternative software and hardware position systems suitable for use in navigation system which apply \gls{rtk-gps}, namely \gls{rtklib} with a Ublox Lea M8T receiver and a Piksi system. Both the Piksi and the Ublox receiver are single-frequency \gls{gnss} receivers. These systems will in this work be compared and their individual capability to provide accurate position estimate will be evaluated. 

The \gls{rtk-gps} system is implemented in DUNE (DUNE:Unified Navigation Environment) framework running on an embedded payload computer on-board an \gls{uav}.

The performance of these position systems are in this work investigated by experimental testing. The testing showed that the \gls{rtklib} performed better than the Piski alternative, and further showed the tested navigation system provide sufficient quality for integration into a control and guidance system, allowing for automatic landing of an \gls{uav} in a net.
